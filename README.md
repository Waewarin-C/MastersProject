# Masters Project - ColorPlan

## Waewarin Chindarassami

### This is a repository for the project that is one of the options for the masters degree.
### This project is now complete and archived.

## Calendar Application
ColorPlan is a basic calendar application for desktop. The application is currently for a single user. The user is able to add events to the calendar and assign categories to those events. The events displayed on the calendar are color coded based on the category.

When the application loads for the first time, the user will be shown the Login/Sign Up page, and the user will be required to sign up. Once signed up, the user will be redirected to a Welcome page where they will get a quick overview of the application features. The Welcome page can be shown first everytime after the user logs in or loads the application if they did not log out by changing the settings. 

The user can then move on to the Home page and can begin using the application. 

To exit the application, the user can logout or close the window. 

From the second time forward, when the application loads the user will login if they had logged out, or they will immediately be shown the Welcome or Home page depending on the user's settings.

Below are the main pages and are displayed on the bottom navigation of every view:
* Home
  * A quick overview of the week ahead starting from the current date
  * Add, edit, and delete events for those seven days
  * Logout
* Calendar
  * Monthly view
  * Go to a specific date
  * Simply click on a date to view its events
  * Add, edit, and delete events
* Add Events
  * Add events to the calendar
  * Can also add new categories while adding new events
* Categories
  * Add, edit, and delete categories
* Settings
  * View and edit account and preference settings
  * Logout

### Running the Program
Simply clone the repo and run it

### Future Directions
There is hope to implement a weekly view in the calendar so that the user will be able to switch between monthly and weekly views, and possibly having the user set a default calendar view in the settings.

Also hoping to expand the application to be able to keep track of mulitple accounts so that it can work with mulitple users.
