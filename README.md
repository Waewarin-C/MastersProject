## Calendar Program
ColorPlan is a basic calendar program for desktop. The application is currently for a single user. The user is able to add events to the calendar and assign categories to those events. The events displayed on the calendar are color coded based on the category.

When the program first loads, the user will be shown the Login/Sign Up page, and the user will be required to sign up. Once signed up, the user will be redirected to a Welcome page where they will get a quick overview of the application features. The Welcome page can be shown first everytime after the user logs in or loads the application if they did not log out by changing the settings. 

The user can then move on to the Home page and can begin using the application. 

To exit the application, the user can logout or close the window. 

From the second time forward, when the program loads the user will login if they had logged out, or they will immediately be shown the Welcome or Home page depending on the user's settings.

Below are the main pages and are displayed on the bottom navigation of every view:
* Home
  * A quick overview of the week ahead starting from the current date
  * Add, edit, and delete events for those seven days
  * Logout
